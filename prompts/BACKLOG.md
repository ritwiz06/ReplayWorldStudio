# Backlog

Baseline copied from the project plan. Rows marked "Baseline status: planned" are not started; rows with a "Status" line record verified progress. If a newer live backlog exists, use it and record its path in PROJECT_STATE.md.

P0 is required for its milestone; P1 is negotiable while preserving the workflow; P2 is expansion. Dependencies are planning prerequisites, not evidence that a gate has passed.

## M0

### SET-01 - Inspect repository and environment

- Priority: P0
- Dependencies: None
- Status: **done** (2026-10-09)
- Done when: Record branch, status, remotes, OS and tool versions without overwriting files.
- Evidence: docs/environment.md records the directory contents (only `prompts/`), the absence of any Git repository (no branch, status or remotes to record; `git init` not run, ADR-012), OS, CPU, GPU, memory, browsers and tool versions. No existing file was overwritten except the live records this kit designates.

### SET-02 - Create typed web/API baseline

- Priority: P0
- Dependencies: SET-01
- Status: **done** (2026-10-09)
- Done when: Browser health flow and malformed-input rejection work from documented setup.
- Evidence: `pnpm test:e2e` 4/4 passed against the real API and Vite servers. Covered: API online and fixture loaded with units and evidence; contract-breaking response shown with its path, then recovered by Retry; unreachable API reported; negative-dimension, duplicate-ID and non-JSON files rejected with locations while the current scene is kept. `services/api/tests/test_api.py` covers 422 paths, no input echo, CORS allow/deny and loopback defaults. Manual curl: dev servers listen only on 127.0.0.1.

### SET-03 - Establish contracts, docs and CI

- Priority: P0
- Dependencies: SET-02
- Status: **done** (local 2026-10-09; CI 2026-10-10)
- Done when: Schema check, build and smoke workflow pass; exact dependency versions are locked.
- Evidence: `pnpm check` exit 0 (contracts:check, lint, typecheck, Vitest 19, pytest 48, build) in the working tree and in a clean copy installed from `uv.lock` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` with `--locked` / `--frozen-lockfile`. Direct versions are exact in every manifest. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same commands. After two setup failures (no `setup-uv@v10` major tag; broken pnpm 11.12.0), CI run 38022453114 passed on `28ebce7`: https://github.com/ritwiz06/ReplayWorldStudio/actions/runs/38022453114. Docs: README.md, docs/environment.md, docs/contracts.md, docs/learning/M0-foundation.md.

## M1

### WRL-01 - Define world and asset records

- Priority: P0
- Dependencies: SET-03
- Status: **done** (2026-10-10, commit `a3b1328`)
- Done when: Units, transforms, stable IDs and asset provenance round-trip correctly.
- Evidence:
  - Contract 0.2.0 adds per-axis `Length` evidence, embedded `CatalogAsset` records with explicit source and SPDX-style rights, `SceneObject.asset_id` with validated references, and an explicit 0.1.0 → 0.2.0 migration with a CLI (ADR-015..017).
  - Round-trip tests: exact fixture round-trip; awkward floats, `-0.0`, π/7 rotation and punctuated IDs survive bit-for-bit; asset provenance and rights round-trip; the legacy upgrade preserves every value.
  - Rejection tests: non-positive or string lengths; missing per-axis evidence; the old flat shape; uncertainty outside the value or reaching 0; non-SI units; non-finite values; unstable object and asset IDs; dangling asset references; kind mismatches; duplicate asset IDs; free-text licenses; NOASSERTION claiming redistribution; uncited vendor sources; legacy version.
  - Local: `pnpm check` exit 0 (pytest 97, Vitest 10 + 17); `pnpm test:e2e` 4 passed, including the inspector's per-axis evidence and asset rights and the legacy and dangling-reference rejections.
  - CI run https://github.com/ritwiz06/ReplayWorldStudio/actions/runs/38023211602 succeeded on `a3b1328`.

### WRL-02 - Build industrial scene and cameras

- Priority: P0
- Dependencies: WRL-01
- Status: **done** (2026-10-10, commit `9571b49`)
- Done when: Walk/top/orbit views and coherent lighting work with dimensioned catalog assets.
- Evidence:
  - Contract 0.3.0 `GltfVisual` (ADR-018, ADR-022).
  - Four original deterministic GLB models (ADR-020): conveyor, machine cell, cabinet, pallet; 3–14k triangles and 5–13 PBR materials each.
  - A 15-object industrial demo, labelled synthetic and loaded by default; three conveyors share one model, as do the two cells, two cabinets and two pallets.
  - Catalog-library resolution and verification (ADR-019).
  - Orbit, top and walk cameras (ADR-021).
  - Tests:
    - Vitest: every demo instance's drawn model fills its recorded box to 0.1 mm and rests on the floor; rotated and stretched instances; hash, invalid-glTF, bounds, 404, unsafe and offline failures; framing, plan orientation and scale bar; walking, collision and floor limits.
    - pytest: glTF field validation, symlink and unsafe paths, missing and altered files on open, an independent GLB parse matching the manifest and fixture.
    - Playwright: demo load, all three modes with the selection kept, labelled fallbacks with actionable errors and retry, unsafe or unavailable paths in opened files.
  - Local `pnpm check` exit 0 (pytest 161, Vitest 10 + 52) and `pnpm test:e2e` 8 passed, also from a fresh clone of `9571b49`. Screenshots inspected at 1440×900 and 1600×960.
  - CI https://github.com/ritwiz06/ReplayWorldStudio/actions/runs/38025828571 succeeded on `9571b49`, including byte-identical model rebuilds on Linux.
  - Frame-rate performance is **not** measured; that is WRL-04.
